I'm workin on the react application setup with redux store.
I did the initial create-react-app setup.

Now I need to Create a store for the application to store first name, last name, email and message. Can you help me?

Of course! Here's a step-by-step guide to set up a Redux store for your React application to store first name, last name, email, and message:

Install Redux and React-Redux

First, you'll need to install Redux and the React bindings for Redux:

bash
Copy code
npm install redux react-redux
Create Action Types

In src/redux/actions/actionTypes.js:

javascript
Copy code
export const SET_FIRST_NAME = "SET_FIRST_NAME";
export const SET_LAST_NAME = "SET_LAST_NAME";
export const SET_EMAIL = "SET_EMAIL";
export const SET_MESSAGE = "SET_MESSAGE";
Create Action Creators

In src/redux/actions/index.js:

javascript
Copy code
import * as actionTypes from './actionTypes';

export const setFirstName = (firstName) => ({
    type: actionTypes.SET_FIRST_NAME,
    payload: firstName
});

export const setLastName = (lastName) => ({
    type: actionTypes.SET_LAST_NAME,
    payload: lastName
});

export const setEmail = (email) => ({
    type: actionTypes.SET_EMAIL,
    payload: email
});

export const setMessage = (message) => ({
    type: actionTypes.SET_MESSAGE,
    payload: message
});
Create Reducers

Create a reducer to handle the actions. Let's say, userReducer in src/redux/reducers/userReducer.js:

javascript
Copy code
import * as actionTypes from '../actions/actionTypes';

const initialState = {
    firstName: '',
    lastName: '',
    email: '',
    message: ''
};

const userReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case actionTypes.SET_FIRST_NAME:
            return { ...state, firstName: action.payload };
        case actionTypes.SET_LAST_NAME:
            return { ...state, lastName: action.payload };
        case actionTypes.SET_EMAIL:
            return { ...state, email: action.payload };
        case actionTypes.SET_MESSAGE:
            return { ...state, message: action.payload };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

export default userReducer;
Combine Reducers (if you have or will have more than one reducer)

For this example, I'll assume you might have more reducers in the future.

In src/redux/reducers/index.js:

javascript
Copy code
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import userReducer from './userReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
    user: userReducer
    // other reducers go here
});

export default rootReducer;
Create the Store

In src/redux/store.js:

javascript
Copy code
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(
    rootReducer,
    window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()  // This line is optional but it helps you use Redux DevTools
);

export default store;
Provide the Store to the Application

Now, in src/index.js, wrap your App component with the Provider component and pass in your store:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './redux/store';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
    </Provider>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
Usage in Components

You can now use useDispatch to dispatch actions and useSelector to select data from the state in your components:

javascript
Copy code
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { setFirstName, setLastName, setEmail, setMessage } from './redux/actions';

function UserInfoComponent() {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const firstName = useSelector(state => state.user.firstName);

    return (
        // your JSX here...
    );
}
You now have a Redux store set up for your application to handle user information! Adjust as needed for your specific application needs.
